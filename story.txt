Joe is an ordinary student. He goes to school everyday on time and is never 
late. He doesn't know what he wants to do in the future, and never think about
it seriously. He is neither short,nor tall. He is neither poor, nor well-being.
He isn't particularly smart either. He is so average in every thinkable way
that you would start to consider it an achievement.
