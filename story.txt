Joe is an ordinary student. He goes to school everyday on time and is never 
late. He doesn't know what he wants to do in the future, and never think about
it seriously. He is neither short,nor tall. He is neither poor, nor well-being.
He isn't particularly smart either. He is so average in every thinkable way
that you would start to consider it an achievement.

Joe started to become concerned that his mediocrity was beginning to become a
burden on his life and those around him. Everywhere he went, people glanced at
him and immediately looked away, not out of disgust or fear, but out of
boredom. He set out to cure himself of his absolute lack of anything at all.
